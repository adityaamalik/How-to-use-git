Assuming that you have setup a local repository on your machine (if you haven't please check the Git local repository setup tutorial), we can now sync our local git repository with our remote git repository.

Following are the steps to setup remote git repository.

1. Sign-up on gitHub and keep your username and Password handy.

2. Initiate a new repository from the GitHub. Give a repository name and select public/private repository.

3. Once you have initiated, GitHub displays a "Quick setup" page which gives you various options to create a new repository or import an existing repository. We will be importing an existing repository from our local machine.

4. On the setup page of GitHub, a link of your repository will be highlighted , copy that link, it would look something like - "https://github.com/adityaamalik/Temporary.git"

5. Open terminal and change directory to your current project.

6. Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/adityaamalik/Temporary.git" ( in place of the link, you will use your own repository link

7. You will be prompted to enter your username and password of GitHub.

8. Finally type - "git push -u origin master". This is gonna take some time to upload all the files. Local repository will be pushed to the remote repository and you can keep them in sync.
