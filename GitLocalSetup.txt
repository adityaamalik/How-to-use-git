Steps to setup Git local repository in our local machine

1. In the "working repository" type - "git init"
2. Type "git add ." to add all the files to the repository
3. (Optional) check the status of staged files by typing "git status"
4. (Optional) to remove everything from the staging area , type - "git rm --cached -r ."
5.  To commit the staged changes we type "git commit -m "<some message>" "
6. If you made some changes and messed up some files since the last commit, we use "git      checkout" to go back to the last commit.

-------------

These are all the useful commands to setup a local repository on your machine and maintain the versions of your project using git.
